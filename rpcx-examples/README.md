# Examples for the latest rpcx

A lot of examples for [rpcx](https://github.com/by1e11/rpcxio-go)


## Run 101basic/client/async/client_async.go (streaming response)
redircted the rpcx module to ../../rpcxio-go

run directly:

```bash
go run 101basic/client/async/client_async.go
```

Only works after you have started the [python server](https://github.com/by1e11/rpcx-python)
